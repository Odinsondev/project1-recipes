# odin-recipes
My first Odin project - Recipes


Assignment overview:

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. 
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops;
I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
